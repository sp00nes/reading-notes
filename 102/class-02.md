## Text Editors and IDE's

Text editors are programs that you either download to your computer or can access online. They allow you to write text and save files however you would like. They might also highlight when you miswrite something or if you could do it in a way the language wants a bit more. IDE's (Integrated Development Environment) do a lot more they manage files, debug and compile all in one.

## Terminal/Ubuntu

You can use the terminal to access everything on your computer, just like if you use a file manager that is usually part of the OS. The terminal doesn't have a GUI, so you cant click around to find the files you like. You need to tell the terminal what and where you want it to do. You can use the terminal to create, destroy, and manage files.

`pwd` (print working directory) to have the terminal tell you where in the files you currently are.

`ls` (list) will list all the contents in the location your at.

`ls -a` will list any hidden files as well.

`Clear` clear is a nice tool to clear the terminal so it doesn't get crowded.

`cd` (Change directory's) is how you move your location

- `cd my-demo-file`
- `cd ~/my-demo-file/class-01/`
- `cd ..` (brings you back one directory for every dot after the first.)

`touch` allows you to create files.

`tree` visual file "tree"

`code .` opens VS code at location.
