1. Physical hand drawn sketch

    - made by hand on paper

Simple black and white shapes to represents key elements you would see on a screen in there simplest form.
scetch it out twice

### 6 steps to make a wireframe

1. Do your research

    - Do a little bit of UX design research before you start wireframing.

2. Prepare your research for quick reference

    - Make a cheat sheet of all your goals for the UI

3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out

    - Think about the user flow. how many pages the user will need to go through during a task and where on the page will they be directed.

4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate

    - How can you organize the content to support your users’ goals?
    - Which information should be most prominent? Where should your main message
    - go? What should the user see first when arriving at the page?
    - What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?
    - Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?

5. Add some detail and get testing

    - add a little detail into your wireframe add it from top to bottom left to right
    - Think about the following:

        - Usability conventions, such as putting the navigation at the top next to your logo, having a search box on the top right, and so on
        - Simple, instructional wording for i.e. calls-to-action
        - Trust-building elements: What do you need to build trust in your customers and where would be the best place to put these elements?
        - Tooltips to indicate any functionality that could be included in a prototype transition

6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

    - Think of

        1. Clarity
        2. Confidence
        3. Simplicity is key

## HTML

An HTML element is made up of and opening tag that defines the content and a closing tag that surrounds the content Elements can also have attributes the attribute usually lives in the tag or defined on a septate CSS document.

`<p class="classid">Hello World</p>` Example of an element with an attribute.

`<meta charset="utf-8">` This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages.

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">` This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.

CSS is in charge of all style in the document.
