# Class 01 Reading Notes *(9/19/22)*

## Growth Mindset

**A growth mindset means understanding that you can learn and become smarter if you just put your time and energy into working to understand what you are attempting to learn.**

1. Remember that knowledge is learned, not inherently known
2. Remember that the most brilliant programmers once knew less than you
3. Remember to take a break when things get confusing and try again

## Markdown

Markdown is a way to organize and stylize text in a document. It allows you to do things like **bold text** (\*\*bold text**), *italicize text* (\*italicize text*), or even ~~strike through~~ (\~\~strike through\~\~) text if needed. The reason we would use markdown over something like Microsoft word or another wysiwyg (what you see is what you get) editor is that you don't have to have to click all over the page to style things. You can style it as you go by adding a few tags here and there.
