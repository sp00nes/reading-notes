## Git

Git is a version control system. it holds on to a history of changes that you make to your files and saves them in a timeline as a new version with each "commit" you make.

GitHub uses git to allow you to collaborate with others and work on projects together

Repository is a folder or directory that is tracked by Git. you can tell git to track individual folders on your computer. generally one project lives in one repository.

`git clone https://github.com/<user id>/<name of repository>` Makes a clone of GitHub repository.

`git add <file name>` Adds one file in que to be committed.

`git add .` Adds all changed files to be committed.

`git commit` Commits changes to git.

`git commit -m "<message>"` Commits changes to git with a message.

`git push origin <branch>` pushes changes to Github repository
