## React lifecycle

1. Render
2. Constructor
3. componentDidMount, Render, Constructor, componentWillMount, React Updates
4. Allows us to execute React code when the component is already in the DOM

## React State Vs Props

1. functions, state, data
2. props are the information that was passed down from a parent, state is an object in a component
3. When we change it properties or state, usually after a user input or a data update on a parent component
4. things that need to be re-rendered, something that needs to be updated.
