## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. its designed for x,y coroneted items. no z
2. the main axis is the x axis and the cross axis is the y axis
3. sometimes it hides content from the reader

## CSS layout

1. Flexbox intuitively moves the objects and gives you more control
2. This will allow me to position web apps I make.
