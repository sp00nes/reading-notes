## HTML Forms

1. so that the user is able to input into the content.
2. add label and input connected together so that the software is able to identify everything and interact with it. 
3. form is important because it makes the form, button is used to submit, input gives you input boxes, legend is like your header

## Learn JS

1. events allow you to watch the code and see if the user does anything
2. what you are listing to and what to go when clicked (cant remember the syntax rn)
3. the event object allows to get a lot of info from the DOM
4. event bubbling check when something happens in the container and capturing is what was clicked.
