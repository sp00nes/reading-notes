## Using Images In HTML

1. when visually impaired software needs to read aloud what the image is.
2. by adding detailed alt text
3. you can use the figure element to add a caption that is semantically linked to the image
4. gifs are images that move, svg don't move
5. png, they have good compression.

## using colors in css

1. background is under the foreground. all things like text boxes colored will be on the foreground
2. add some bright color for the title with a more neutral color that matches for the bg
3. what they will look like... obviously.
4. size is the size. weight makes it bold and style can make it italic.
5. word spacing and letter spacing.
