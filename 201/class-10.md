## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

1. syntax errors occurs when something is typed out wrong, logic errors are when something is off logically.
2. I spell everything wrong so i get a lot of syntax errors, luckily the console tells me where it gets confused.
3. I will be able to fix my code faster.

## JS Debugger

1. it allows you to run or stop the code where you want and observe what went wrong.
2. breakpoints are where you tell the code to pause.
3. The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
