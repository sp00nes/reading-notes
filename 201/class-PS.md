## Psychological Safety

- This topic matters because as we are gearing up for project week we need to know how to work with everyone.
- Im sorry *null* for not being Psychological Safety, i promise to be more open minded
- The topic was mostly about how you need to allow the other members in your group to suggest new things in a safe environment.
