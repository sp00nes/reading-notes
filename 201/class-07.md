## domain modeling

1. We need domain modeling so that we can add elements with java script.

## HTML table basics

1. because they are set to a grid and have very little fluidity.
2. table, tr, td

## introducing constructors

1. a constructor is something used to create an object
2. this is referenced to the new object and things inside it.

## object Prototypes using a constructor

1. We are sorry that we thought everything needs to be hardcoded in, we will not think so closed mindedly from now on.
